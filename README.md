## Description

The Job Board App allows users to create accounts as either job posters or job seekers. Job seekers can fill out a form with their personal information and upload their resume to apply for a job. When logged into their accounts they can see what jobs they've applied for. Job posters can post jobs, and log in to their accounts to see applications that have been submitted. They can also change the status of jobs they've posted from active to inactive.


## Technologies Used
